Have you ever spent hours trying to figure out a problem and after you walk away from it or you just give up trying to solve it, then the solution just comes to you?

Or you try to remember a persons name for a long time then suddenly in the middle of the night the names pops into your head.

Actively working on the problem for hours on end, will not help you solve it. Your brain is too active and too easily distracted.

Sometimes the best solution for solving a problem or just being more productive is to just __*walk away and quiet your mind*__.

##Increase Your Productivity

Take some time every day and just *do nothing*. Here are a few ways to let your mind wander while you relax and a few things to avoid.

* __Take a walk outside__ – preferably in a park or in a nature setting.
* __Take a shower or quiet bath__ – I've solved a lot of problems in a nice warm shower.
* __Try meditation__ – meditation comes in many forms, but the point here is too just empty your mind.
* __Try Tai Chi__ – this ancient Chinese mind-body practice is perfect for relaxing. Also referred to as "*meditation in motion*".
* __Yoga__ – an ancient Hindu mind-body practice, helps to reduce stress and helps you become calm and centered.
* __Do deep breathing exercises__ – Breathing deeply helps you calm down and feel more relaxed.
* __Get a massage__ – There is nothing like a great massage to relax. If money is tight, some massage schools let students work on clients at a discount.
* __Listen to a Nature Sounds CD__ while closing your eyes and relaxing, doing yoga or meditating.

<h3 style="text-align: center;">The mind cannot relax and come up with solutions if you are keeping it busy by doing something else.</h3>

* __Avoid reading__
* __Avoid the television__
* __Avoid the radio or loud music__
* __Avoid all electronic devices (phones - tablets)__

Do whatever it takes to help you to relax your mind and you will increase your productivity.
