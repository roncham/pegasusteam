                  <p>We help small to medium sized businesses and non-profits transform their business by building an affordable modern website so you can make more money and have more time to focus on what matters.</p>
                  <p><hr /></p>
                  <p>I have been building HTML websites since 1996. WordPress sites since 2005. For the past two decades I have created websites for myself, friends as well as for clients.</p>
                  <p>My wife and I have both been involved in Internet Marketing in one form or another since we first got computers in the mid 90â€™s. Although we followed the usual path of joining various programs and being disappointed, we have pretty much learned our lessons and now focus on building the web. One site at a time.</p>
                  <p>I first met my wife online around 1999. We had a long distance relationship and formed PegasusTeam and worked together online for 4 years before we finally made the plunge and got married. We both relocated here to Las Vegas and have been enjoying our life and business ventures together!</p>
